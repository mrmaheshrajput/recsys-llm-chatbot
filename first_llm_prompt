The previous conversation is always passed to you where text after <|prompter|> and before next <|assistant|> tag is the user's message. And text after <|assistant|> tage and before next <|prompter|> tag is the chatbot's response. There can be multiple <|prompter|> and <|assistant|> tags in one conversation. The products recommended are between these tags only. You must understand the whole conversation and try to deciper the relevant apparel choice based on the occassion if applicable before extracting or generating relevant content. And . Like in the following conversation, the correct output should be "blue full slevees shirt" and not "pink shorts" because now user is talking about blue shirts for winter.
